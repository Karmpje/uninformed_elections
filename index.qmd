# Introduction

The concept of polarization is a long-standing and well-known phenomenon in political sciences, especially relevant to democratic government systems. In plain English, polarization refers to the division of society into distinct groups based on differing agendas, beliefs, opinions, goals, needs, and priorities, which are expressed and debated as part of the democratic process. As a result, these divisions often shape the direction of legislation and policy drafting as opposing factions attempt to advance their values, ethics, and moral frameworks through executive governance. 

The most common examples of polarization occur along ideological divides, such as the left and right political spectrum (e.g., liberalism and conservatism), religion (secularism and theocracy), economics (communism and capitalism), and social policy (libertarianism and authoritarianism). In countries with a two-party system (an example of which is the United States), the polarizing divide predominantly matches the tensions of partisan identities.

While polarization occurs in any democracy, an interesting detail unique to the United States is the persistence and stability of these societal and political divides. In other words, voters, states, and politicians often adhere strictly to the party lines at any given decision time. Deviations from the stable voting trajectory patterns are rare but highly consequential, usually reflecting major societal dissatisfaction. Moreover, these abnormalities are immensely powerful in turning the scales, as it is safe to assume that each party has a relatively equal electorate population. Thus, while statistically almost improbable, U.S. history is abundant in examples of a single vote tipping the election balance (see, for example, https://middletonma.gov/303/The-Power-of-One-Vote).

This project seeks to examine cases where electoral outcomes diverge from established partisan norms or reported public opinion. Identifying these nonconformities could shed light on the presence and impact of structural misinformation or disinformation within American society. Per rational choice theory (i.e., justified decision-making), any such divergence shall be deemed a priori irrational, for it does not reflect true and honest communication of voter preferences. Thus, understanding these gaps could provide insights into the mechanisms driving such irregularities and offer a deeper understanding of voter priorities extending beyond the traditional party lines.
