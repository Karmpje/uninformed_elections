This repo contains a final project for the Fall 2024, Section 2, Exploratory Data
Analysis and Visualization class at Columbia University.

This project is currently being developed, but it will focus on documenting paradoxical
trends in the U.S. elections data sourced mainly from the Pew Research Center and the
American National Election Studies databases. In short, the goal is to document any cases
of misinformation and inadequate information affecting the American electorate.
